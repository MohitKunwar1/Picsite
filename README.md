# React + Vite
## Project Title : Picsite
_Picsite is a dynamic image gallery web application inspired by Unsplash.com. This project is built using React with Vite.js, a frontend tooling that significantly improves the development experience. The application fetches high-quality images from the Lorem Picsum API and displays them in an intuitive user interface. Navigation within the application is managed by React Router, ensuring a seamless user experience. The applicationâ€™s aesthetic appeal is enhanced using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable designs. Furthermore, various React hooks are utilized throughout the project to manage state and side effects, making the code more readable and maintainable. Picsite showcases the power of modern frontend technologies in creating efficient, responsive, and visually appealing web applications._
